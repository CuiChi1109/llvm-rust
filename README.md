LLVM-RUST
============

This repository provides Rust bindings to the [SBIP-customized version of
LLVM](https://github.com/sbip-sg/llvm-project).

## Installation

Please follow the guide in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to install Rust and LLVM.

We also need to install some useful tools to support the developments:

- [`rustfmt`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt): for auto-formatting code.

- [`rust-analyzer`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer): an IDE assistant to write fast and quality code.
